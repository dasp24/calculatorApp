# calculator app
This is an application that works the same as a calculator, and looks like the one commonly found on apple computers. I decided to make this to improve upon my understanding of both React and Redux as well as my core JavaScript skills.

If you would like to set this up locally, this project uses Node v6.11.3.

Double check you have this installed by running ``node -v`` in your terminal.

You can always download the latest version <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">here</a>.

Follow these steps to set up this project locally:

`git clone https://github.com/dasp24/calculatorApp.git`

`cd calculatorApp`

`npm install`

`npm start`

The webpack will automtically compile and will open a webpage on http://localhost:3000/

Alternatively you can view the app <a href="https://hidden-thicket-85815.herokuapp.com/">here</a>
